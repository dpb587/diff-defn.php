=================

Version control systems provide great insight into files and lines that change over time. Oftentimes, the more important
piece is how application definitions change (e.g. classes, interfaces, and functions) - especially when libraries are
used as third-party dependencies.

The goal of this tool is to analyze PHP code and provide a summary of code changes.
